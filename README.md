# Hydroacoustic-Catalog-Processing-Toolkit
Open source python toolkit for analyzing underwater acoustic events recorded by hydrophones. It extracts arrival times and signal levels, converts timestamps for analysis, estimates source bearings using triangulation, and visualizes directional distributions with custom polar plots. Ideal for marine acoustics research and environmental monitoring.
